# Keeping it simple... stupid?

Is keeping it simple still the thing to do these days?

I would know if I wasn't making this up.

... Yea? Don't agree? Here's a form.. File a complaint.. See if I care.

<form name="complaint" method="POST" netlify>
	<input name="name" type="text" placeholder="Name"><br>
	<textarea name="complaint" placeholder="Complaint">
	</textarea><br><br>

	<button>File Complaint</button>
</form>
